Hi there, I'm Miro ðŸ‘‹

I love kicking off new open source initiatives and leading them to success. I am a co-founder of the following projects:

 * [LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse-lsp4j/lsp4j) (2016)
 * [Sprotty](https://github.com/eclipse-sprotty/sprotty) (2017)
 * [Open VSX](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx) (2019)
 * [Langium](https://github.com/eclipse-langium/langium) (2021)
 * [VS Code Messenger](https://github.com/TypeFox/vscode-messenger) (2022)
 * [Open Collaboration Tools](https://github.com/eclipse-oct/open-collaboration-tools) (2024)

I have also enjoyed contributing to many other open source projects, including [Xtext](https://github.com/eclipse-xtext/xtext), [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) and [ELK](https://github.com/eclipse/elk).

Are you looking for professional support about these technologies? [TypeFox](https://www.typefox.io) is your ideal partner for the development of complex custom tools.
